**Musalasoft Event Booking App:**

FUNTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

1.  Create an account;
2.  User authentication to log into the system;
3.  Create events;
4.  Search and reserve tickets for events;
5.  Send notification to users before event starts.
6.  Event users should subscribe, listen and get notification messages.

**_NB:_** _To test out the implemented functional requitements: Simply run the “_**_functionalRequirementTest_**_” integration test inside the \`_**_UserApiRestControllerTests_**_.java\` file to see all the implemented functional requirements running._

NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

1.  The project MUST be buildable and runnable;
2.  The project MUST have Unit tests;
3.  The project MUST have a README file with build/run/test instructions (use a DB that can be run locally, e.g. in-memory, via container);
4.  Any data required by the application to run (e.g. reference tables, dummy data) MUST be preloaded in the database;
5.  Input/output data MUST be in JSON format;
6.  Use a framework of your choice, but popular, up-to-date, and long-term support versions are recommended.

REQUIREMENT TO RUN THE APP:  
1\. JDK v17 (LTS). The sample is built with Spring Boot 3.xxx

2\. Maven 3x

3\. Docker desktop (WSL 2.0 for windows OS)

NB: Ensure Java, mvn and docker-compose are in your system path before trying to start the demo app.

TESTING THE APP:  
1\. CD into the **&lt;base folder&gt;/bookings**

**2\. Run: docker-compose -f .\\compose.yaml up -d**

This demo app uses the docker compose to load the dependent services:  
1\. Maria DB: To store the booking app database

2\. Active MQ: For event notification

**3\. Run: mvn clean;mvn package**

We need this step to run all test and generate sample data. Take note that the tests also contain the “_functionalRequirementTest_” which does run integrations test to confirm all the implemented functional requirements.

**4\. CD into &lt;base folder&gt;/bookings/target**

**5\. Run: java -jar booking-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar**

ASSUMTIONS MADE IN THIS DEMO APP PROJECT:  
1\. This is a test project therefore:

1.  There is no requirement for an accurate event timing and notification.
2.  There is no requirement to test for a in ability to book an even due to capacity

ANY ISSUES:  
Please, ensure that other app is not using port 8080.

API ENDPOINTS: _See the added pictures for screenshot of local postman calls._
